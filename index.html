                           <p>When was the last time you stood in a queue to pay your phone bill or book an airline ticket? Chances are you paid for it online or on your phone. As high-speed mobile internet services become easier to access in urban centres and even Tier 2 cities, leather wallets may be going out of fashion – and they are being replaced by mobile wallets.</p>
                           <p>While online banking and even mobile banking has been around for a long time, mobile wallets – which hold your money digitially – have made it easier. If you have ever taken an Uber ride you know how this works: you load money on a digital wallet through your bank account and then use that stored cash to digitally pay for a myriad of services.</p>

                           <p>Over the past four years, mobile wallet transactions have jumped from Rs 10 billion of transactions in 2012-'13 to more than Rs 490 billion in the year 2015-'16. Taxi app Uber’s adoption of Paytm went some way in popularising mobile wallets among those who weren’t before using the services, and even pushed its competitor Ola to build a wallet of its own.</p>
                           <p>But it’s not just the value of transactions that is overwhelming, it’s the rate at which mobile wallets are being adopted by users. Scroll crunched the numbers put out by RBI and it turns out that the value of transactions carried out through mobile wallets have grown by a humongous 500% between 2014-'16. Meanwhile, the number of transactions carried out through m-wallets have doubled in the same time period.</p>

                  <p>With the introduction of Mobile Wallet, it has become extremely convenient for a person to make cashless transactions. And although a number of companies have cropped up in India, offering consumers this product called ‘mobile wallet’, there is still a lack of awareness among people about the concept and its utility.</p>
                  <p>Vijay Shekar Sharma, CEO, PayTM said,<b> <i>“Users can be classified into four categories. First category is of people who have credit/debit cards and are at ease using that mode of payment. Second category people who have cards but still prefer using COD. Third category is people who do not have cards, so they have to use COD. And the fourth category is of people who want to use COD but merchants do not deliver products to their pin codes. Mobile wallets addresses issues of all four categories of people. It caters to users convenience over using cards. Availability of a person to make COD is mandatory, however with the wallet this problem also gets solved. It a tough pull for the industry to get all COD users to mobile wallet but ultimately it holds an immense scope.”</i></b></p>
